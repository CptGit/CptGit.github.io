  <p>
    My favorite video game franchise is
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Red_Alert_(series)">
      <i>Command & Conquer: Red Alert</i>
    </a>. I have been playing with them since I was an eight-year-old
    boy. I have organized seven tournaments for the game(s) since
    2017. My dream is to visit all the video game cities or places in
    real world (I have visited two of them, Los Angeles and San
    Francisco), to make a movie for the franchise and to develope the
    next generation of the series, which should be Red Alert 4.
