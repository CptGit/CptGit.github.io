  <p>
    My favorite video game franchise is
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Red_Alert_(series)">
      <i>Command & Conquer: Red Alert</i>
    </a>. I have been playing with them since I was an eight-year-old
    boy. I have organized six tournaments for the game(s) since
    2017. One of my dreams is to visit all the video game cities or
    places in real world. (I have visited two of them, Los Angeles and
    San Francisco.) Another dream is to make a movie for the franchise
    and the last one is to make the next generation of the series,
    which should be Red Alert 4.
