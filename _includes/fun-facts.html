  <p>
    My favorite video game series is
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Red_Alert_(series)">
      <i>Command & Conquer: Red Alert</i>
    </a>. I have been playing with them since I was an eight-year-old
    boy. I have hosted five tournaments for the game(s) since 2018. I
    have visited two video game cities (Los Angeles and San Francisco)
    in real world. I have also included in my life list a film adaption
    and a next generation (RA4) of this game series.
