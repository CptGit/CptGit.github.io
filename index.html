<p>Hi! My name is Zhiqiang Zang (臧志强).</p>

<p>
  I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.ece.utexas.edu/">Department of Electrical and Computer
  Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>,
  working with Prof. <a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~gligoric/">Milos
  Gligoric</a>. My main research interests lie in software
  engineering, formal methods, and systems with focus on improving
  software quality and developers' productivity. I'm currently
  exploring other interesting topics, such as computer games and
  software engineering (CGSE).
</p>

<p>
  I obtained my B.E. in Telecommunication Engineering at <a href="https://www.bupt.edu.cn">Beijing
  University of Posts and Telecommunications</a> in 2018</a>.
